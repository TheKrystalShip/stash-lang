# Stash Language — Project Guidelines

Stash is a cross-platform scripting language for system administration. The interpreter is .NET-based and compiles to native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It combines C-style syntax with first-class shell command execution (`$(...)` syntax), built-in data structures (structs, enums, dictionaries), and 35 namespaces of standard library functions. Language features and standard library additions must work across all three platforms.

## Architecture

```
Stash.Core          → Lexer (two-pointer scanner), Parser (recursive-descent), 54 AST node types
Stash.Stdlib        → Built-in metadata registry, model records, single source of truth for all namespaces
Stash.Bytecode      → Bytecode VM (compiler + register-based VM), 94 opcodes, 35 built-in namespaces
Stash.Analysis      → Static analysis engine, rules, resolvers, visitors for diagnostics and tooling
Stash.Cli           → REPL + script runner (Native AOT)
Stash.Lsp           → Language Server Protocol (OmniSharp — NOT AOT, requires reflection)
Stash.Dap           → Debug Adapter Protocol (OmniSharp — NOT AOT, requires reflection)
Stash.Check         → Static analysis CLI (Native AOT)
Stash.Format        → Code formatter CLI (Native AOT)
Stash.Tap           → TAP test framework runtime
Stash.Tpl           → Templating engine
Stash.Scheduler     → Cross-platform OS service management (systemd, launchd, Task Scheduler)
Stash.Playground    → Browser-based interactive playground (Blazor WASM, Monaco editor)
Stash.Registry      → Package registry server (ASP.NET Core, EF Core, JWT auth)
Stash.Tests         → xUnit test suite (5,800+ tests)
```

**Key constraint:** LSP and DAP use OmniSharp/DryIoc which requires reflection. They must **never** be built with Native AOT — only the CLI uses AOT. See `build.stash` for publish commands and binary size guards.

The VS Code extension lives at `.vscode/extensions/stash-lang/` (TypeScript — LSP/DAP clients, TAP test runner, syntax highlighting).

## Project Layering

```
Layer 0 (Foundation)  → Stash.Core (no dependencies)
Layer 1 (Libraries)   → Stash.Stdlib, Stash.Analysis, Stash.Tpl, Stash.Scheduler
Layer 2 (Runtime)     → Stash.Bytecode (depends on Core + Stdlib + Tpl)
Layer 3 (Tooling)     → Stash.Cli, Stash.Lsp, Stash.Dap, Stash.Check, Stash.Format, Stash.Playground, Stash.Registry
Layer 4 (Tests)       → Stash.Tests, Stash.Tap
```

Core never depends on anything else. Bytecode depends on Stdlib (not the other way around — stdlib built-ins are injected via `IStdlibProvider`). LSP, DAP, and Registry cannot reference each other.

## Build & Test

```bash
dotnet build                            # Build all projects
dotnet test                             # Run all xUnit tests
dotnet run --project Stash.Cli/ -- file.stash   # Run a script
dotnet run --project Stash.Cli/         # Start REPL
```

Test a specific namespace: `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ArrBuiltInsTests"`

## Code Conventions

- **C# style:** File-scoped namespaces, nullable enabled, 4-space indent, LF line endings
- **Naming:** `PascalCase` public, `_camelCase` private fields — enforced in `.editorconfig`
- **var usage:** Never for built-in types (`string`, `int`), always when type is apparent from RHS
- **AST nodes:** Each has a `SourceSpan` for diagnostics. Expression nodes implement `IExprVisitor<T>`, statement nodes `IStmtVisitor<T>`
- **Built-in namespaces:** One file per namespace in `Stash.Stdlib/BuiltIns/` (e.g., `ArrBuiltIns.cs`). Register functions via `BuiltInFunction` delegates
- **Tests:** `{Feature}_{Scenario}_{Expected}()` naming in `Stash.Tests/`, one test file per namespace (`ArrBuiltInsTests.cs`, `DictBuiltInsTests.cs`, etc.)
- **No magic strings or literals:** Never write a string (or other literal) inline when a named reference already exists — use the existing constant, property, or identifier. If no reference exists, create one before using the value. Duplicated literals scattered across the codebase are an absolute failure to follow this rule.

## Key Patterns

- **Visitor pattern:** Six visitors implement `IExprVisitor<T>` and `IStmtVisitor<T>` — Compiler, SemanticResolver, SemanticValidator, SymbolCollector, SemanticTokenWalker, StashFormatter. When adding a new AST node, update ALL visitors
- **Partial classes:** Large visitors are split by responsibility (e.g., `Compiler.cs` has 9 partials: Expressions, ComplexExprs, Collections, Strings, ControlFlow, Declarations, Exceptions, Helpers). Follow this pattern for new visitor logic
- **VM type protocols:** 12 `IVM*` interfaces in `Stash.Core/Runtime/Protocols/` (IVMArithmetic, IVMComparable, IVMEquatable, IVMTruthiness, IVMStringifiable, IVMFieldAccessible, IVMFieldMutable, IVMIndexable, IVMIterable, IVMIterator, IVMSized, IVMTyped). All domain types implement relevant protocols — never add hardcoded type cascades to VM dispatch
- **Error flow:** `RuntimeError` (C# exception) during execution → converted to `StashError` (first-class Stash value) when caught by `try/catch` in Stash code. `AssertionError` extends `RuntimeError` for test reporting

## Language Semantics (for writing tests and interpreting behavior)

- **No type coercion on equality:** `5 != "5"`, `0 != false`, `0 != null`
- **Truthiness:** Falsy values are `null`, `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`
- **Short-circuit returns operands:** `null || "default"` → `"default"`, `"a" && "b"` → `"b"`
- **Reference equality** for dictionaries and struct instances (no value-based `Equals`)
- **Shallow copy** on `dict.merge` — nested structures are shared, not cloned

## Documentation

Detailed docs live in `docs/` — link to these instead of duplicating content:

## Specialized Agents

This project has a team of Claude Code agents in `.claude/agents/`. For complex or multi-step work, invoke the appropriate agent rather than working directly.

| Agent | Model | When to use |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| `orchestrator` | Opus | Multi-phase features, large refactors, implementing a kanban spec end-to-end |
| `architect` | Opus | Feature design, spec writing, kanban backlog work, feasibility analysis |
| `reviewer` | Opus | Code review after implementation — reads `.kanban/3-review/` specs autonomously |
| `profiler` | Opus | Performance investigation, benchmarking, dispatch loop analysis |
| `implementer` | Sonnet | Code changes (typically spawned by orchestrator, not invoked directly) |
| `explore` | Haiku | Fast read-only codebase search (spawned by other agents, not invoked directly) |
| `debugger` | Sonnet | Tracing runtime bugs, writing minimal repro cases, inspecting bytecode behavior |

For design work → use `architect`. For a full feature from spec to tested code → use `orchestrator`. For a suspicious test failure or runtime behavior → use `debugger`. For a regression after a change → use `profiler`.

## Project Memory

`.claude/repo.md` is the persistent memory shared across agent sessions. It contains the current build state, active work, enduring architecture decisions, and known gotchas. Read it when starting any architectural or multi-step task.
